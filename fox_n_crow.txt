In a lush forest, under the shade of ancient oaks, lived a cunning fox and a vain crow. One sunny morning, the crow perched high on a branch, a piece of delicious cheese clutched in its beak. The fox, his sharp eyes catching sight of the cheese, hatched a clever plan. "Oh, Crow," he called out sweetly, "how beautiful you are! Your feathers are so glossy, your eyes so bright. Surely, your voice must be the most melodious in all the forest. Won't you sing for me?" Flattered by the fox's compliments, the crow opened its beak to caw, and down fell the cheese. The fox snapped it up with a grin, leaving the crow to rue its foolish pride. Thus, the fox taught a valuable lesson: beware of those who flatter, for they may have hidden motives.
